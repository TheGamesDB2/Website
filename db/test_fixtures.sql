The game screen features four bars, each with a keg at one end and a door at the other. Customers enter through the doors and slowly advance toward the kegs, demanding service. The player controls a bartender who must pour drinks and slide them down the bar for the customers to catch. Pushing the joystick up or down instantly moves the bartender to the keg at the next bar in the chosen direction, with the top and bottom of the screen wrapping around to one another, while pushing left or right causes him to run along the bar where he is stationed. When the tap handle is pulled down, the bartender instantly moves to the keg (if he is not already standing there) and fills a mug; releasing it causes him to slide the mug along the bar.\r\n\r\nCustomers slide back toward the doors upon catching a full mug, and disappear through the doors if they are close enough. If not, they stop after a certain distance, consume the drink, and resume their advance while sliding the empty mug back toward the keg. Customers occasionally leave tips on the bar, which the player can pick up for bonus points. Collecting a tip causes a group of female dancers to appear for a few seconds, distracting a portion of the customers so that they will stop advancing. However, distracted customers cannot catch drinks, and any customers who are either drinking or being pushed back at the start of the dancers&#039; show will never be distracted.\r\n\r\nOne life is lost when any of the following occurs:\r\nThe player fails to catch an empty mug before it falls off the keg end of a bar and breaks.\r\nA full mug slides to the door end of a bar without being caught, where it falls and breaks.\r\nAny customer reaches the keg end of a bar, whereupon they grab the bartender and slide him across the bar out the door.\r\n\r\nEach screen is completed when the bar is completely emptied of customers. The bartender then pours/consumes a drink of his own with humorous results involving the empty mug, such as getting it stuck on his head or stubbing his toe when he tries to kick it. As the game progresses, the customers appear more frequently, move faster along the bar, and are pushed back shorter distances when they catch their drinks. In addition, the maximum number of customers per bar gradually increases until every bar can have up to four customers at a time.\r\n\r\nThe player proceeds through four levels, each with its own theme and appropriately dressed customers, and must complete a set number of screens to advance from one level to the next. The levels are:\r\nA western saloon with cowboys (2 screens)\r\nA sports bar with athletes (3 screens)\r\nA punk rock bar with punk rockers (4 screens)\r\nAn outer-space bar with aliens (4 screens)\r\n\r\nA bonus round is played after the end of each level, in which six cans of beer (or root beer) are placed on the bar. A masked figure shakes five of the cans, then pounds the bar to shuffle them. Choosing the one unshaken can awards bonus points, while choosing any other results in the bartender being sprayed in the face; in the latter case, the unshaken can flashes briefly to indicate its position.\r\n\r\nAfter completing all four levels, the player returns to the start of the sequence and continues the game at a higher difficulty level.','2024-10-30 20:30:05','E - Everyone',NULL,'2018-06-13 00:22:45','No',23,'No','dqrRKStaN_4',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Root Beer Tapper',2,50),

Vekta&#039;s orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.\r\n\r\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet&#039;s harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.\r\n\r\nThe player takes control of I.S.A. Captain Jan Templar, who is fighting off the Helghast invasion. Templar and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the I.S.A. operative Gregor Hakha and the information in his possession. During the course of the game, the player also takes control of several other characters, such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Staff Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.\r\n\r\nAs the game progresses the player discovers that General Stuart Adams, a high ranking ISA officer, is a traitor and a servant of Joseph Lente (the commanding General of The Third Helghast Special Forces Army) and was responsible for sabotaging the SD platforms, rendering them unable to defend against the Helghast. The Earth Defense Fleet (EDF) go to assist the Vektan Army, however Adams kills General Voughton and receives his security key, allowing him to reboot the platforms, and prepare an ambush for the EDF relief force.\r\n\r\nJan and the others confront Lente, only to find out that Hakha was a commander in chief for him. Lente says that Hakha&#039;s family was ashamed to even be related to him, except his brother who talked of his heroism. Because of this, Lente had Hakha&#039;s brother shot down. With anger in his eyes, Hakha shoots Lente dead.\r\n\r\nThe team fly to the central SD platform and confront Adams, who is wounded by Templar. The platform begins to break up and Adams is killed by falling debris while trying to escape.
